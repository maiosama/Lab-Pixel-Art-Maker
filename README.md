# Lab-Pixel-Art-Maker
This is the lab2 in the scholarship of the One Million Arab Coders (1MAC) and UDACITY.
In this Lab, you'll develop a grid of cells where you can create an amazing 8-bit pixel masterpiece. On the following page, you'll be able to launch your Lab. Inside the Lab, you'll be given instructions and a workspace where you can code your project.

When you're ready to see how you're doing, press the "Run Code" button! A panel will open to display the progress of the automatic grader. If one of the rules doesn't pass, make sure to read the grader's feedback carefully to see what needs to be changed.
